# About Ro-Se.AI

Welcome to Ro-Se.AI! This innovative AI combines the best features of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Gemini, creating a unique conversational partner designed for engaging and entertaining interactions.


## Key Features
- Discord Integration: Ro-Se.AI can chat with you via Discord and even join video calls, making conversations feel more personal and interactive.

- Text-to-Speech: Utilizing a free text-to-speech API, Ro-Se.AI can "speak" to you, adding a fun audio dimension to your chats.

- Local Server: Ro-Se.AI runs on a local server, which means it has a limited invite capacity of 8-10 users. This ensures a more intimate chat experience.

- Slang & Gen Z Friendly: With a knack for slang and an understanding of Gen Z culture, Ro-Se.AI provides engaging conversations that resonate with today's youth.


## Warning!!!
Educational Use Only: Ro-Se.AI is intended solely for educational purposes. Please use it responsibly and ethically.

API Limitations: Ro-Se.AI operates on free API usage. The Gemini Flash 1.5 model has over 1 million free tokens, and ChatGPT has a limited range. After 1 million uses, the API will need to be replaced.

Content Filters: The AI is equipped with basic content filters that block only highly dangerous content. Unfortunately, to enhance these safeguards would require a $3500 investment, which is currently beyond reach.

Memory Constraints: Ro-Se.AI can only remember the current conversation. If it resets, any previous discussions will be lost. I'm actively working on improving this feature for future updates.
