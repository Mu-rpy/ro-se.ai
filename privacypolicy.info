This Privacy Policy outlines how Ro-Se.AI (the "Bot") collects, uses, and protects user data while interacting with the Bot. By using Ro-Se.AI, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this policy.

1. Data Collection
User Messages: Ro-Se.AI collects and processes the text, voice, or video messages you send during interactions with the Bot. These interactions are limited to the specified channels and direct messages (DMs) that the bot is authorized to engage with.

Server Information: When Ro-Se.AI is added to a server, it may collect basic server information (such as server ID, channel IDs, and server name) necessary to function properly.

Metadata: Ro-Se.AI may collect metadata, such as timestamps, message IDs, and other relevant data for operational purposes (e.g., ensuring functionality and improving the bot’s performance).

No Personal Identification Information (PII): Ro-Se.AI does not actively collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your real name, address, or email address, unless you voluntarily provide such information while communicating with the Bot.

2. Data Usage
Bot Functionality: The data collected is used solely to provide and improve the functionality of Ro-Se.AI, ensuring smooth interactions and response generation.

Data Retention: Interaction data may be stored temporarily to enhance Ro-Se.AI’s performance and user experience. Stored data will only be kept as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose or to comply with legal obligations.

No Commercial Use: Ro-Se.AI does not sell, rent, or trade user data for marketing or any other commercial purposes.

3. Third-Party Services
Discord: As Ro-Se.AI operates on the Discord platform, user interactions with the Bot are subject to Discord’s Privacy Policy. Ro-Se.AI relies on Discord’s infrastructure for communication and storage of interactions. Please refer to Discord's Privacy Policy for more information.

No Third-Party Data Sharing: Ro-Se.AI does not share user data with any third-party services, companies, or individuals, except as required by law or with the user's consent.

4. User Control
Consent: By using Ro-Se.AI, you consent to the collection and use of your data as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Data Deletion: Users may request the deletion of their data by contacting the Bot’s owner, Mu.rpy, via email at jderpyteststuff9@gmail.com. Upon request, any stored interaction data will be deleted within a reasonable time, subject to legal or operational constraints.

5. Data Security
Protection of Data: Ro-Se.AI takes reasonable measures to protect user data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure, and as such, Ro-Se.AI cannot guarantee absolute security.

Discord’s Security: Since Ro-Se.AI operates within Discord’s infrastructure, data security is also subject to Discord’s security practices. Please review Discord’s security policies for further information.

6. Children’s Privacy
Age Restrictions: Ro-Se.AI is intended for users who are 13 years of age or older, in compliance with Discord’s Terms of Service and privacy policies. The Bot does not knowingly collect data from users under this age threshold. If we discover that data from a child under the age of 13 has been collected, it will be deleted promptly.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
Amendments: This Privacy Policy may be updated or modified over time to reflect changes in our practices, legal obligations, or user feedback. It is your responsibility to review this policy periodically. Continued use of Ro-Se.AI constitutes acceptance of any changes made.
